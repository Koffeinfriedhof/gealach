How to translate:

Example:
translate into german:

Make sure your language is set to de_DE.UTF-8 or use
>export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8<
to set it and call
>./Messages.sh de<

Running Messages.sh without an argument will create a template file called org.kde.plasma.userbase.gealach.pot in translation/.

Edit the translations/org..gealach-de.po file and set corresponding msgstr.

After editing run ./Messages.sh without an argument. It will create a corresponding .mo-file

To install files you have either to install it using cmake; make; sudo make install
OR just copy your .mo-file to /usr/local/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/_plasma_applet_org.kde.plasma.userbase.gealach.mo

Other languages:
You just have to replace all "de"'s in this document to view an example in your language. (but de_DE.UTF-8)
