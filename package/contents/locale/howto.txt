How to translate:

Example: translate into german:

Make sure your language is set to de_DE.UTF-8 or use
>export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8<
to set it.

On first use you need to create the folder manually:
>mkdir -p de/LC_MESSAGES<
and call
./Messages.sh

If there is already another translation present, just run
>./Messages.sh<

Edit the de/LC_MESSAGES/gealach.po file and set corresponding msgstr.

Do not forget to set your credits to be honored by all wolves howling to the moon!
